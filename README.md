# Statistical Learning

These are my class notes for students
[my automated learning
graduate course](https://elisa.dyndns-web.com/teaching/sys/apraut/)
based on the
textbook
[The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-84858-7) available
in PDF
at
[Haestie's website at Stanford](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf).
The data sets used in the examples are from the [book's website](https://www-stat.stanford.edu/ElemStatLearn).

## Chapter 1

Frequent uses: prediction, classification, factor identification

Elements: 

+ an outcome measurement (qualitative or quantitative)
+ a set of features (extracted from the input data)
+ a subset of the data set aside for training (the rest for
  validation)
+ the goal is to build a _model_ (a.k.a. learner) 

When the training data comes with a label indicating the intended
outcome, this this **supervised learning**. In the unsupervised case,
there are only features and the goal is more like _clustering_.

Examples: 

- is an email spam?
- does a patient have cancer?
- which handwritten digit is this?
- are some of these genes related to certain types of cancer?

### Homework 1

Identify one or more learning problems in your thesis work and
identify their goals and elements. Write the description with GitHub
markdown in the README.md of your course repository.
